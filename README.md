*Please read the instructions and fill in the blanks*


One Paragraph of project description goes here

## Getting Started

Clone current project by using following command :
```bash
    git clone git@github.com:sonia-auv/proc_image_processing.git
```

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

**IMPORTANT :** *If you have just imported your repository, please follow the instructions in* [BOOTSTRAP.md](BOOTSTRAP.md) (Once the bootstrap completed, you can remove this comment from the README)

### Prerequisites

First and foremost to run the module you will need to have [docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=getstarted&utm_content=sitelink&utm_term=getstarted&utm_budget=growth&gclid=CjwKCAjw57b3BRBlEiwA1Imytuv9VRFX5Z0INBaD3JJNSUmadgQh7ZYWTw_r-yFn2S4XjZTsLbNnnBoCPsIQAvD_BwE) installed.

To validate your installation of docker, simply type in

```
docker -v
```

If you receive an output in the likes of :
```
Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea
```

It means you have it installed. If not follow instructions on how to install it for your OS.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
